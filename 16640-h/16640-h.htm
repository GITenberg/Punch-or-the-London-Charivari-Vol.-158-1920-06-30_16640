<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>Fewer births are recorded in Ireland during the past seven months. No
  surprise can be felt, for we cannot imagine anybody being born in Ireland
  on purpose just now.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A London firm are now manufacturing what they call the smallest
  motor-car on the market. How great a boon this will be to the general
  public will be gathered from the report that one of these cars has been
  knocked down by a pedestrian.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a Sunday paper <font class="sc">Mustapha Kemal</font>
  wants as soldiers only those who will die for their belief in his cause.
  Previous experience is not essential.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Citizens of Ealing have protested against Sunday concerts unless
  Sunday bathing is also permitted. The pre-war custom of merely sponging
  the ears after attending a recital was never wholly satisfactory.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to an inscription on the score card of the North Berwick
  Club, "golf is a science in which you may exhaust yourself but never your
  subject." Several clubs, however, claim to possess colonels who can say
  practically all that is worth saying about the game without stopping to
  get their second wind.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Girls have broadened out a lot, declared a speaker at the annual
  conference of the Head-mistresses' Association. The home-made jumper, it
  appears, has been coming in for a good deal of unmerited blame.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A middle-aged man was charged at the Thames Police Court the other day
  with having an altercation with a lamp-post. It appears that the man
  called the lamp-post "Pussyfoot," and the latter promptly knocked him
  down.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Special courts, it is stated, are to be set up for the trial of Irish
  criminals. The need, we gather, is for some machinery by which the trial
  can be conducted in the absence of the prisoner.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"I have put in a good three months in the garden," Mr. <font
  class="sc">Smillie</font> told a reporter, on his return to London, "and
  have coaxed some nice red roses out." Coaxing the nice red miners out is
  comparatively easy work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>On a question of equipment Ashford Fire Brigade has resigned. It is
  not known yet whether local fires will go out in sympathy with the
  Brigade.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Letchworth, the first Garden City, has voted itself dry by a majority
  of sixty-five. There seems to be a lack of hospitality in this attempt to
  discourage American visitors.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The latest news from Turkey, Russia and Ireland sets us wondering what
  the War made the world safe for.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Ants, we are informed, will not come near the hands of a person if
  well rubbed with a raw onion. The last time we attempted to rub an ant
  with a raw onion he broke away and made a dash for the hills.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Chicago Tribune</i> points out that two attempts have been made
  on the life of the <font class="sc">ex-Kaiser</font>. It is hoped that he
  will realise that it would be a breach of etiquette to get assassinated
  before the Allies have decided what is to be done with him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that one of the New Poor who recently found a burglar in
  his house searching for money immediately offered the intruder ten per
  cent. if he proved successful.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Referring to the report in these columns last week that two
  bricklayers were seen to remove their coats at Finsbury Park, we now hear
  that it was simply done to oblige a photographer who was understood to
  have been sent down by Dr. <font class="sc">Addison</font>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Among the articles left in trains on a South Coast railway is a
  sandwich. Unless claimed within three days we understand that it will be
  broken up and sold to defray expenses.</p>

<hr />

<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE.</h2>

  <p>Mr. Punch begs leave to draw the attention of the Intelligent Public
  to the fact that on Monday next, July 5th, he proposes to publish a
  Special Summer Number. All his previous Summer Numbers have appeared in
  the form of an ordinary weekly issue, with additional holiday and other
  matter. This is a Special Summer Number, altogether distinct from the
  weekly issue. It will contain thirty-six pages, almost entirely made up
  of drawings, and including several pages of illustrations in three
  colours. Mr. Punch has great pleasure in inviting his friends to
  encourage him in this new venture.</p>

<h2>HOLIDAY ANTICIPATIONS.</h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[Now that holiday-planning is in season we have pleasure in announcing
  a few proposed schemes for the recreation of some of the mighty brains
  that shape our destinies and guide our groping intelligences. But it must
  be clearly understood that in these inconstant times we cannot vouch for
  their authenticity or guarantee fulfilment.]</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font class="sc">Mr. Asquith's</font> recent success in spotting the
  winner of the Derby is believed to have inspired Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font> with an idea of combining his present
  policy of always going one, if not two or three, better than the Old Man
  with a public demonstration of the extent to which the crude Puritanism
  of his youth has been mellowed by sympathies more in keeping with his
  later political alliances. He is credited with the intention of putting
  to appropriate use his peculiar gifts of non-committal prophecy and
  persuasive casuistry, and at the same time making sure of a profitable
  holiday in the open air by "doing" the Sussex Fortnight, beginning with
  the Goodwood meeting, in the capacity of Downy Dave, a race-course
  tipster.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There is reason to believe that, if the Recess should afford Sir <font
  class="sc">William Sutherland</font> an opportunity to indulge his
  craving for the Simple Life, he will proceed to Italy to join the coterie
  of ascetics known as the Assisi Set. His conspicuous ability in telling
  the tale to the London Pressmen encourages expectations that he will be
  no less successful as a preacher to the birds, after the manner of St.
  <font class="sc">Francis</font>, the founder of the cult.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In financial circles it is expected that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Chamberlain</font> will spend the vacation <i>incognito</i> in
  the neighbourhood of Blackpool, partly for the sake of the invigorating
  air, but mainly, in view of the abnormal prosperity of Lancashire, for
  the purpose of considering on the spot the possibilities of a levy on
  capital as a local experiment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A rumour is current in Whitehall, and gains colour from the activity
  in certain seaports, that, in consequence of Earl <font
  class="sc">Curzon's</font> having been informed that the number of
  Channel-swimmers is likely to be unusually large this summer, his
  lordship has decided to take command of a fleet of Foreign Office
  launches, which will patrol the coast to make sure that none of these
  persons is unprovided with a passport.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>At Unity House a suspicion is entertained that Sir <font
  class="sc">Eric Geddes</font> contemplates utilising the holidays for the
  double purpose of working off superfluous steam and familiarizing himself
  with the true attitude of the railwaymen by working as a stoker on one of
  the great main lines. Should this scheme be carried into effect
  arrangements are in readiness to compel him to become a member of the
  N.U.R.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is hoped that Mr. <font class="sc">Augustus John</font> will be
  able to accompany Lord <font class="sc">Beaverbrook</font> to Canada this
  summer, so that his lordship may gratify his lifelong ambition to be
  painted by Mr. <font class="sc">John</font>, with the primeval backwoods
  for a setting, in the character of a <i>coureur-des-bois</i>, of the type
  immortalized by Sir <font class="sc">Gilbert Parker</font> in
  <i>Pierre</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>As far as can be ascertained, Mr. <font class="sc">Bernard Shaw</font>
  intends to devote the holidays to verifying the report of his namesake,
  Mr. <font class="sc">Tom Shaw</font> (with whom he has been stupidly
  confused), on the Bolshevik <i>régime</i>. He will probably enter Russia
  secretly, accompanied by a mixed party of vegetarian Fabians disguised as
  Muscovites, so that in the event of being denounced as Boorjoos they may
  hope to pass for returning Dukhobors, or, in case of detection, for an
  amateur theatrical company touring with <i>Labour's Love's Lost</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that Lords <font class="sc">Lonsdale</font> and <font
  class="sc">Birkenhead</font> are making arrangements for a joint trip to
  Cuba, in order to investigate personally the condition and prospects of
  the Havana leaf industry. It will not be surprising if this visit bears
  fruit in the shape of the eighteen-inch super-cigar which sporting men
  have been for so long demanding.</p>

<hr />

<h2>ON THE EATING OF ASPARAGUS.</h2>

  <p>There were twenty-three ways of eating asparagus known to the
  ancients. Of these the best known method was to suspend it on pulleys
  about three feet from the ground and "approach the green" on one's back
  along the floor; but it was discontinued about the middle of the fourth
  century, and no new method worthy of serious consideration was
  subsequently evolved, till the August or September of 1875, when a Mr.
  Gunter-Brown wrote a letter to the <i>A.A.R.</i> (<i>The Asparagus
  Absorbers' Review and Gross Feeders' Gazette</i>), saying that he had
  patented a scheme more cleanly and less unsightly than the practice of
  tilting the head backward at an angle of forty-five degrees and lowering
  the asparagus into the expectant face, which is shown by statistics to
  have been the mode usually adopted at that time.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gunter-Brown's apparatus, necessary to the method he advocated,
  consisted of a silver or plated tube, into which each branch of
  asparagus, except the last inch, was placed, and so drawn into the mouth
  by suction, the eater grasping the last uneatable inch, together with the
  butt end of the tube, in the palm of his hand. Asparagus branches being
  of variable girth, a rubber washer inserted in the end of the tube
  furthest from the eater's mouth helped to cause a vacuum.</p>

  <p>The inventor claimed that the edible portion of the delicacy became
  detached if the intake of the eater was strong enough, but he overlooked
  the fact that the necessary force caused the asparagus to pass through
  the epiglottis into the &#339;sophagus before the eater had time to enjoy
  the taste (as was proved by experiment) and so all sense of pleasure was
  lost.</p>

  <p>More prospective marriages have been marred through the abuse of
  asparagus at table than through mixed bathing at Tunbridge Wells. For
  instance, though the matter was hushed up at the time, it is an open
  secret among their friends that Miss Gladys Devereux broke off her
  engagement to young Percy Gore-Mont on account of his <i>gaucherie</i>
  when assimilating this weed at a dinner-party. It seems that he simply
  threw himself at the stuff, and that one of the servants had to comb the
  melted butter out of his hair before he could appear in the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>The case of the Timminses, too, presents very sad features, though the
  marriage was not in this case abandoned, the high contracting parties not
  having once encountered a dish of asparagus simultaneously during the
  engagement. Yet it is more than rumoured that when, at the end of the
  close season, asparagus may be hunted, there is considerable friction in
  the Timminses' household, because Mrs. Timmins plays with a straight
  fork, while Timmins affects the crouching style.</p>

  <p>Happily, however, a light at last appears to be shining through the
  darkness. Under the auspices of the Vegetable Growers Association (Luxury
  Trades section) an asparagus eating contest has been arranged to take
  place in the Floral Hall early in July. As the entrants to date include a
  contortionist and at least three well-known war-profiteers it is
  confidently expected that some startling methods will be exhibited which
  may revolutionise asparagus-eating in this country.</p>

<h2>A NOTE ON CHESTERFIELDS.</h2>

  <p>In the Soviet Republic of Russia, I am told, no one can lay claim to
  the title of worker unless his hands are hardened and roughened by toil,
  and <font class="sc">Lenin</font> and <font class="sc">Trotsky</font>
  have to take their turns at the rack, like the commonest executioner. In
  England we are not nearly so particular about the manual test, and,
  besides feeling quite kindly disposed towards professional footballers,
  tea-tasters and the men who stand on Cornish cliffs and shout when they
  see the pilchard shoals come in, we still give a certain amount of credit
  to mere brain-work as well.</p>

  <p>There is, however, a poisonous idea prevalent, especially amongst the
  women of this country, that a fellow is not working with his brain unless
  he is walking rapidly up and down the room with wrinkles on his forehead,
  or sitting on a hard chair at a table with a file of papers in front of
  him. But there is no rule of this sort about the birth of great and
  beautiful ideas in the human brain. It is all a matter of individual
  taste and habit. I know a man, a poet, who thinks best on the Underground
  Railway, and that is the reason why he said the other day, "Give me to
  gaze once more on the blue hills," to the girl in the booking-office,
  when what he really wanted was a ticket (of a light heliotrope colour) to
  St. James's Park. Lord <font class="sc">Byron</font>, on the other hand,
  composed a sorrowful ditty on the decadence of the Isles of Greece whilst
  shaving; but the invention of the safety-razor and the energetic action
  of M. <font class="sc">Venizelos</font> will most likely render it
  unnecessary for anyone to repeat such a performance. As for the people
  who have a sudden bright idea whilst they are dressing for dinner, they
  may be dismissed at once, for they nearly always go to bed by mistake
  and, when they wake up again extremely hungry, they have forgotten what
  it was.</p>

  <p>Most experts are really agreed that a recumbent or semi-recumbent
  position is the best for creative thought, and another friend of mine,
  also a maker of verses, has patented the very ingenious device of a pair
  of stirrups just under the mantelshelf, so that, when he sits back in his
  armchair, he can manage his Pegasus without having his feet continually
  slipping off the marble surface into the fender.</p>

  <p>Much may be said too for a seat in a first-class railway carriage,
  when you have the compartment all to yourself and the train is going at
  sixty miles an hour or more. But England is hardly spacious enough for a
  really sustained inspiration; and the result of being turned out suddenly
  at Thurso, N.B., or Penzance is that some opening flower of the human
  intellect fails to achieve its perfect bloom, and as likely as not your
  golf clubs are left in the rack.</p>

  <p>There is also, of course, an influential school which believes
  strongly in the early morning tea hour, and people who ought to know tell
  me that Mr. <font class="sc">Winston Churchill</font> plans new uniforms
  for the Guards as well as the campaign in Mesopotamia with pink pyjamas
  on, and that the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> can never be
  persuaded to get up for breakfast until he has hit on a few of those
  striking repartees which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page505"
  id="page505"></a>[pg 505]</span> are subsequently translated by his posse
  of interpreters into Russian, Italian, Bohemian and Erse.</p>

  <p>For my part, however, I swear by a Chesterfield sofa, a large one, on
  which you can lie at full length, as I am lying now; the most comfortable
  thing there is on earth, I think, except perhaps a truss of hay, when one
  has been riding for about six consecutive hours in an army saddle. But
  there are disadvantages even about a Chesterfield sofa. It is, to begin
  with, in the drawing-room and in the drawing-room one is not so entirely
  immune from the trivial incidents of everyday life as I like to be when I
  am having brain-waves. Doors are opened and this creates a draught, and
  it is not the slightest use attempting a real work of imagination when
  people will come in and ask if I am lying on <i>The Literary
  Supplement</i> of <i>The Times</i> (as if it were likely), or the
  anti-aircraft gun that the children were playing with after lunch. For
  this reason I have had to invent an even better thing than the ordinary
  Chesterfield sofa, and since it will be, when made, the noblest piece of
  scientific upholstery in the world I will ask the printer to write the
  next sentence in italics, please.</p>

  <p><i>It is a Chesterfield sofa enclosed on all four sides.</i> Thank
  you.</p>

  <p>The marvels of this receptacle for human thought will dawn upon the
  reader by slow degrees. Try to imagine yourself ensconced there, having
  climbed up by the short flight of steps which will be attached to it,
  enisled and remote amidst the surging traffic that sweeps through a
  drawing-room. Instead of making a rapid bolt to escape from callers and
  probably meeting them full tilt in the hall, you simply stay on,
  thinking. You have nothing to fear from them, unless they are so
  inquisitive and ill-mannered as to come and peep over the edge. With
  plenty of tobacco, a writing tablet and a fountain-pen, you can stare at
  the anaglypta ceiling and dream noble thoughts and put them down when you
  like without interruption. On sunny days the apparatus can be wheeled on
  to the balcony, where the sapphire sky will be exchanged for the
  anaglypta ceiling; and for winter use a metal base will be supplied,
  under which you can place either an oil-stove or an electric
  radiator.</p>

  <p>I should like to see this four-sided Chesterfield in offices also. The
  master-strokes of commercial and administrative skill would be much more
  masterly with most people if they did not have to proceed from a hard
  office chair. You can easily dictate to a typist from the interior of a
  Chesterfield, and, though I know that business men and Government
  officials are often subjected to deputations, during which they have to
  look their persecutors in the face, this difficulty could be overcome by
  means of a sliding panel, through which the face of the recumbent
  administrator could be poked when necessary, wearing the proper
  expression of shrewdness, terror, conciliation or rage. I should like Sir
  <font class="sc">Eric Geddes</font> to have one of my four-sided
  Chesterfields.</p>

  <p>With his usual sagacity the reader will probably remark here that the
  four-sided Chesterfield can be procured ready-made at any moment by
  turning the usual article round and pushing it up against the wall. This
  point has not escaped notice, my friend. But you can hardly imagine the
  objections that will be urged by the female members of your household
  against adopting such a course in the drawing-room. They will assert,
  amongst other things, that Mrs. Ponsonby-Smith is on the point of
  arriving and that she will think you've done it on purpose.</p>

<h2>DEDICATIONS.</h2>

  <p><font class="sc">Mr. Compton Mackenzie</font> has found it necessary
  to state publicly in a dedication that his books have not been written by
  his sister.</p>

  <p>The following extracts are taken from possible future dedications by
  various authors:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mr. <font class="sc">H.G. Wells</font> to the Bishop of
<font class="sc">London</font>.</i></p>

  <p>As I have seen it stated in various journals that you are the author
  of my book, <i>The Soul of a Bishop</i>, I hereby take the opportunity of
  informing your Lordship most definitely and emphatically that you are
  <i>not</i>. That book and also <i>The Passionate Friends</i> were written
  without any assistance from the episcopal bench. To avoid future
  misunderstanding I may say that all my books are written by myself. If at
  any time it is suggested that any publication of your Lordship has been
  written by me, I shall be glad if you will immediately issue a
  contradiction.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mr. <font class="sc">Bernard Shaw</font> to the Editor of
"The Morning Post."</i></p>

  <p>You have not written my books. You have not written my plays. Any
  statement to the contrary is an infamous falsehood. No one else, dead or
  alive, could ever have written anything which I have written. When I have
  become an imbecile, which is not likely to happen yet, as I am a
  vegetarian and do not read your rag, it will be time enough for other
  people to lay claim to my work. Nor have I ever assisted you in
  conducting that which you call a paper, nor have I ever written an
  editorial for its columns. Please let this matter have your futile
  attention.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Miss <font class="sc">Daisy Ashford</font> to Lord
<font class="sc">Haldane</font>.</i></p>

  <p>If I did not believe your Lordship to be really innosent I should be
  very vexed with you. But let me explain. I have heard it said in reliable
  quarters that you are the auther of <i>The Young Visiters</i>. Oh, my
  Lord! my Lord! I thought everybody knew by now that no one helped me even
  to spell a word. I have read your Lordship's books with pleasure and of
  course realise their promise. But it is all very diferent stuff from
  <i>The Young Visiters</i>. Please in the future disclaim all credit for
  giving me my idears, and in return I can assure you that your skemes for
  the better education of the people shall have my enthoosiastic
  suport.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mr. <font class="sc">Arnold Bennett</font> to The Man
in the Street.</i></p>

  <p>The last thing that I wish is that you should he misunderstood; all my
  life I have laboured to explain you to yourself. That my explanation has
  pleased you is shown by the fact that you buy my books. But you have
  commenced to give yourself airs, my man, and it is time you were put in
  your place. My books are so much to your taste that you have been led to
  believe yourself the author. Now please understand my books are written
  <i>for</i> you and not <i>by</i> you. You merely exist&mdash;thanks to
  me&mdash;and pay. I have been told that I once wrote a book called <i>The
  Old Wives' Tale</i>. If so, that was in earlier days, and you have long
  since forgiven me. And do you not owe me something for <i>The Pretty
  Lady</i>? Have I not shown you that your love is both sacred and profane?
  As I have enough to contend with from those who care for literature I
  hope any further word from me on this subject will be unnecessary.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mrs. <font class="sc">Florence Barclay</font> to Lord
<font class="sc">Fisher</font>.</i></p>

  <p>The phenomenal success of our recent volumes has, I understand, led a
  certain section of our public to believe that you are the author of
  several of my books. In particular it has been stated that <i>The
  Rosary</i> was written by your Lordship. As you know, I have a great
  respect for the aristocracy, and I do not suggest that you have
  deliberately put yourself forward as the author of my books. You will,
  however, understand me when I say that only your Lordship could express
  all that I feel about the matter. The mixing up of our identities is
  probably explained by the fact that we are both stylists and seekers for
  the <i>mot juste</i>. Will you please assist me in making it clear that
  we work independently? As I am staying in a country parsonage and it is
  our custom to read one another's letters over the breakfast-table, I
  shall be glad if any reply you may wish to make should be sent to the
  Editor of <i>The Times</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Sir <font class="sc">Arthur Conan Doyle</font> to Sir
<font class="sc">Oliver Lodge</font>.</i></p>

  <p>Our common concern with the life beyond has become so well known that
  our interests in this present life are in danger of becoming involved. In
  a volume of <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories recently purchased abroad I
  find you described as the author, and another book assures me that I have
  written extensively on the Atomic Theory. You will, I am sure, see the
  harm which I am likely to suffer through such mistakes. Nor does the
  confusion end here. I find that my novel, <i>The Hound of the
  Baskervilles</i>, is now stated to be by Sir <font class="sc">Conan
  Lodge</font>, and another book of mine, <i>The Lost World</i>, to be by
  Sir <font class="sc">Oliver Doyle</font>. Also I have seen myself
  described as "The Principal of Birmingham University," and yourself as
  the well-known detective of Baker Street. May I solicit your aid in
  helping me to suppress any further confusion of our respective genii? My
  best wishes to you and the good work.</p>

<h2>A DOG'S LIFE.</h2>

  <p>The life of a public man is a dog's life. I don't know why a dog's
  life should be the type and summit of unpleasantness in lives; for myself
  I should have thought it was rather a good life; no clothes to buy and no
  shortage of smells; but there it is. The reason is perhaps that a dog
  spends most of his day just finding a really good smell and being
  diverted from it by something else, a loud whistle in front or a
  motor-bicycle or another smell. He rushes off then after the whistler or
  the motor-bicycle or the new smell, missing all kinds of good smells on
  the way and never getting the cream of the old one. And that is like the
  day of the public man.</p>

  <p>He sits up in bed in the morning, having his breakfast and thinking
  over the smells he is going to have during the day. There is an enormous
  choice. The whole of the bed is covered with papers; there are tables on
  either side of the bed covered with papers, letters and memoranda, and
  agenda and minutes and constituents' grievances, and charitable appeals
  and ordinary begs. When he moves his foot there is a great crackling, and
  the surface papers float off into the air and are wafted about the room.
  Each paper represents a different smell. He is going to make a speech to
  the Bottle-Washers' Union at 11 <font class="sc">a.m.</font> and he is
  reading the notes of his speech; but before that he has got to introduce
  a deputation of Fish-Friers to the <font class="sc">Home Secretary</font>
  at ten and he is trying to find out what the Fish-Friers are after. But
  the telephone-bell keeps on ringing and the papers keep on floating away,
  and the papers about the Fish-Friers keep mixing themselves up with the
  papers about the Bottle-Washers, and the valet keeps coming in to say
  that the bath is prepared or the hosier has come, so that it is all very
  difficult.</p>

  <p>All his family ring him up, and all the people who were at the meeting
  last night and were not quite satisfied with the terms of the Resolution,
  and all the people who are interested in Fish-Frying and Bottle-Washing,
  and all the people who want him to make a speech at Cardiff next year,
  and several newspapers who would like to interview him about the Sewers
  and Drains Bill, and a man whose uncle has not yet been demobilised, and
  a lady whose first-born son would like to be President of the Board of
  Trade as soon as it can be arranged. Meanwhile people begin to drift into
  the room. The Private Secretary drifts in with a despatch-case, full of
  new smells and some old ones; and the valet drifts in to say that the
  bath is still prepared, and a haircutter and a man from the shirt-makers,
  and the Secretary of the Fish-Friers, who has looked in for a quiet talk
  about the situation.</p>

  <p>When they are all ready for their quiet talks the public man decides
  that it is time he got up; he leaps out of bed and rushes out of the room
  and shaves and baths and does his exercises very very quickly. Then he
  rushes back and has a talk with the <font class="sc">Home
  Secretary</font> on the telephone while he is drying his ears. When his
  ears are nice and dry he rings off and ties his tie, meanwhile dictating
  a nasty letter to <i>The Times</i> about the Scavengers (Minimum Wage)
  (Scotland) No. 2 Bill. In the middle of this letter two new crises
  arise&mdash;(1) The <font class="sc">Home Secretary's</font> Private
  Secretary's Secretary rings up and says that the Fish-Friers' deputation
  is postponed till 11 <font class="sc">a.m.</font> because of a Cabinet
  Meeting about the new war. (2) The Assistant-Secretary to the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> Principal Secretary's Secretary rings
  up and says that the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> can see the
  public man for ten seconds at one minute past eleven. It is now clear
  that the Bottle-Washers and the Fish-Friers and the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister</font> are going to clash pretty badly, and a
  scene of intense confusion takes place. The public man runs about the
  room in his shirt-sleeves smelling distractedly at the papers on the
  floor and on the bed and everywhere else. Some of the papers he throws at
  the Private Secretary and tells him to write a memorandum about them, and
  go and see the War Office about them and have six copies made of them.
  Most of them, however, he just throws on the floor or hides away in a
  dressing-gown where the Private Secretary won't find them; this is the
  only way of making sure of a permanent supply of good crises. A crisis
  about a lost document is far and away the most fruitful kind of
  crisis.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the valet pursues the public man about the room with spats
  and tries to attach them to his person. If he can attach both spats
  before the Fish-Friers' man really gets hold of him he has won the game.
  The Fish-Friers' man keeps clearing his throat and beginning, "The
  position is this&mdash;"; and the Private Secretary keeps saying in a
  cold dispassionate voice, "Are you going to the Lord Mayor's lunch?" or
  "How much will you give to the Dyspeptic Postmen's Association?" or "What
  about this letter from Bunt?"</p>

  <p>The public man takes no notice of any one of them, but says rapidly
  over and over again, "Where are my spectacles?" or "What have you done
  with the brown socks?" He is playing for time. If he can put them off for
  a little more, some new crisis may occur and he will be able to say that
  he is too busy to deal with them now.</p>

  <p>The Private Secretary knows this and continues to say, "Are you going
  to the Lord Mayor's lunch?" The Fish-Friers' man doesn't know it, and
  crawls about excitedly on the floor looking for the spectacles under the
  bed. When he is well under the bed the public man tells the Private
  Secretary to ring up the Bottle-Washers and the Fish-Friers and the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister</font> and arrange things somehow, and rushes
  out of the room. He is hotly pursued by the valet and the hosier and the
  hairdresser, but there's a taxi at the door and with any <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>[pg 509]</span> luck
  he will now get clear away. In the hall, however, the cook meets him in
  order to give notice, and by the time he has dealt with that crisis the
  Private Secretary has had three wrong numbers and given it up, and the
  Fish-Friers' man has bumped his head and given it up. They give chase
  together and catch the public man just as he is escaping from the
  front-door. The Private Secretary starts again about the Lord Mayor's
  lunch, and the Fish-Friers' man starts again about the position.</p>

  <p>The public man knows now that he is done, so he drives them into the
  taxi and says he will talk to them on the way to the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister</font>. The taxi dashes off, leaving the hosier
  and the hairdresser and the valet wringing their hands in the hall.</p>

  <p>The only thing the public man can do now is to invent a new crisis for
  the Private Secretary, who is still saying in a cold dispassionate voice,
  "Are you going to the Lord Mayor's lunch?"</p>

  <p>So he thinks of one of the letters he has hidden in his dressing-gown
  and tells the Private Secretary that he must have that letter for the
  Bottle-Washers' meeting. Then he stops the taxi at a place where there is
  no Underground and no 'bus, and pushes the Private Secretary out. He has
  disposed of the Private Secretary for the day.</p>

  <p>But the Fish-Friers' man's throat is practically clear by now and he
  gets to work at once. The public man pays no attention but prepares in
  his mind his opening sentences to the <font class="sc">Prime
  Minister</font>. In the Park he sees two other public men walking and he
  takes them into the cab. Each of them has discovered some entirely new
  smells and starts talking about them at once very fast. The public man
  promises to go and try them all immediately. When he gets to the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> he rings up and cancels the
  Fish-Friers and the Bottle-Washers. When he has done that the
  Assistant-Secretary to the <font class="sc">Prime Minister's</font>
  Principal Private Secretary's Secretary comes out and says that the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister</font> has been called away suddenly to
  Geneva.</p>

  <p>The public man then goes off after the new smells. A dog's life.</p>

<h3>POPULAR CRICKET.</h3>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</font>,&mdash;I enclose a cut from
  <i>Le Radical</i>, one of the leading Mauritius papers, and on behalf of
  the lovers of our national game in the island venture to ask for
  information regarding the last match recorded:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Londres, 14 mai, 4 hres <font
  class="sc">p.m.</font>&mdash;Mary-le-bone a battu Nottingham par 5
  wickets; Lancashire a battu Leichester; Sussex a battu Warrick. En second
  lieu un joueur du Sussex a abattu H. Wilson par 187 wickets."</p>

  <p>We are much perturbed at the strange developments that are evidently
  taking place in the game at home. Was this match, we want to know, a
  single-wicket game between the Sussex player and <font class="sc">H.
  Wilson</font>? If so how did he beat him by 187 wickets?</p>

  <p>An ex-captain of the Cambridge eleven living here is of the opinion
  that, in order to make cricket more popular, the numbers of the opposing
  sides are being increased, and that this match must have been between a
  team of, say, a couple of hundred Sussex players and one of a like number
  captained by <font class="sc">H. Wilson</font>, and that only some dozen
  wickets had fallen in the second innings when the match ended. If this is
  the correct interpretation we should be very grateful for the rules, plan
  of the field, etc., as we are most anxious to move with the times in this
  little outpost of Empire.</p>

  <p>I fear however that we shall have some difficulty here in raising two
  teams of more than a hundred-a-side.</p>

  <p>We presume that, as a match of eleven-a-side takes two or three days
  to finish, about six or eight weeks are allotted to this new game.</p>

  <p>Any help that you can give us, Sir, will be much appreciated.</p>

<h3>FROM THE FILM WORLD.</h3>

  <p>As an interesting supplement to the announcement that Sir <font
  class="sc">Thomas Lipton</font> has kindly placed his bungalows and
  estates in Ceylon at the disposal of the East and West Films, Limited,
  for the filming of The Life of <font class="sc">Buddha</font>, we are
  glad to learn that preparations are already well advanced for the
  presentation of the Life of <font class="sc">Hannibal</font> on the
  screen.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Sowerly and Bitterton, the well-known vinegar manufacturers,
  have undertaken to provide the necessary plant for illustration of the
  famous exploit of splitting the rocks with that disintegrating condiment,
  and Messrs. Rappin and Jebb, the famous cutlers, have been approached
  with a view to furnish the necessary implements for the portrayal of the
  tragedy of the Caudine Forks. Professor Chollop, who is superintending
  the taking of the pictures of the battle of Cannæ and the subsequent
  period of repose at Capua in their proper atmosphere, states that he is
  receiving every support from the local condottieri, pifferari, banditti
  and lazzaroni, and expects to be able to complete his task by the late
  autumn.</p>

  <p>A certain amount of antagonism, on humanitarian grounds, has been
  shown by the Italian Government to the importation of a herd of
  elephants, which were essential to the realistic depiction of the passage
  of the Alps by the Carthaginian army; but it is hoped that by the use of
  skis the transit may be effected without undue casualties among the
  elephantine fraternity.</p>

  <p>Lord <font class="sc">Fisher</font> has been invited to impersonate
  <font class="sc">Scipio</font>, and the <i>rôle</i> of <font
  class="sc">Fabius</font>, the originator of the "Wait and See" policy,
  has been offered to Mr. <font class="sc">Asquith</font>, but authentic
  details are as yet lacking as to their decision.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Monday, June 21st.</i>&mdash;While the <font class="sc">Prime
  Minister</font> was celebrating the longest&mdash;and pretty nearly the
  hottest&mdash;day by a <i>vin d'honneur</i> at Boulogne Mr. <font
  class="sc">Bonar Law</font> had to content himself with small beer in the
  Commons.</p>

  <p>The Government, it seems, is to offer its services to effect a
  peaceful settlement between the Imam <font class="sc">Yahya</font> and
  the Said <font class="sc">Idrissi</font>, who are rival rulers in Arabia.
  There is believed to be a possibility that in return the said Said will
  offer his services to effect a peaceful settlement in Hibernia
  Infelix.</p>

  <p>The Government is not so indifferent to economy as is sometimes
  suggested. The <font class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> famous letter to
  the Departments was only written in August last, yet already, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Bonar Law</font> assured the House, some progress has been
  made in reducing redundant staffs, and the Government has
  appointed&mdash;no, I beg pardon, "decided to appoint"&mdash;independent
  Committees to carry out investigations. The hustlers!</p>

    <p><font class="sc">Do you expect me to send the Sergeant-at-Arms to
    fetch the Minister of Transport?</font>&mdash;<i>The <font
    class="sc">Speaker.</font></i></p>
  </div>
  <p>The Member for Wood Green, who urged that the Treasury should prepare
  an estimate of the national income, with the view of limiting the
  national expenditure to a definite proportion of that amount, displayed,
  it seems to me, amazing temerity. The course of taxation in recent years
  encourages the belief that the only thing that restrains the <font
  class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</font> from taking our little all
  is that he does not know how much it is.</p>

  <p>Capt. <font class="sc">Wedgewood Benn's</font> complaint that the
  <font class="sc">Minister of Transport</font> habitually absented himself
  from the House met with little encouragement from the <font
  class="sc">Speaker</font>, who sarcastically inquired if he should send
  the <font class="sc">Serjeant-at-Arms</font> to fetch the delinquent.
  Capt. <font class="sc">Benn</font> then dropped the subject, and Sir
  <font class="sc">Colin Keppel</font> looked relieved.</p>

  <p>The Government insisted on taking the Report stage and Third Reading
  of the Rent (Restrictions) Bill at one sitting, and kept the House up
  till half-past three in order to do it. Dr. <font
  class="sc">Addison</font> had need of what the <font class="sc">Iron
  Duke</font> called "two o'clock in the morning courage" to ward off
  attacks. Once, when Sir <font class="sc">Arthur Fell</font> was depicting
  the desperate plight of the landladies of Yarmouth, forbidden under a
  penalty of a hundred pounds to charge more than twenty-five per cent. in
  excess of their pre-war prices, it looked as if the Minister must give
  way; but with some difficulty he convinced his critics that the clause in
  question had nothing to do with seaside landladies.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, June 22nd.</i>&mdash;In the Lords the Bishops, reinforced
  by the ecclesiastically-minded lay Peers, made a last attempt to throw
  out the Matrimonial Causes Bill. Lord <font class="sc">Braye</font> moved
  its rejection, and was supported by Lord <font class="sc">Halifax</font>
  in a speech whose pathos was even stronger than its argument, and by the
  Archbishop of <font class="sc">Canterbury</font>, who admitted that
  reform of the marriage laws was required, but considered that the Bill
  went a great deal further than was necessary. The <font class="sc">Lord
  Chancellor</font> thereupon re-stated the case for the measure, for which
  be believed the Government were prepared to give facilities in the other
  House, and Lord <font class="sc">Buckmaster</font> repeated his exegesis
  of the vexed passage in St. <font class="sc">Matthew's</font> Gospel, on
  which the whole theological controversy turns. The Third Reading was
  carried by 154 votes to 107.</p>

    <p class="center"><font class="sc">Mr. Denis Henry on the Irish

  </div>
  <p>The Commons in the course of the Irish Debate discussed the failure of
  the Government to prevent the regrettable incidents in Derry and Dublin.
  Colonel <font class="sc">Ashley</font> demanded martial law; Major <font
  class="sc">O'Neill</font> was for organising the loyal population; Sir
  <font class="sc">Keith Fraser</font> approved both courses and advanced
  the amazing proposition that the trouble in Ireland was entirely due to
  the religious question, and that even the Sinn Feiners were loyal to the
  Empire.</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">Attorney-General for Ireland</font> pointed out
  that faction-fighting in Derry was endemic, and drew an amusing picture
  of the old city, where everyone had some kind of rabbit-hole from which
  he could emerge to fire a revolver. As regards the general question he
  denied that the Constabulary had been instructed not to shoot. On the
  contrary they had been told to treat attackers as "enemies in the field,"
  and to call upon suspected persons to hold up their hands.</p>

  <p>Lord <font class="sc">Robert Cecil</font> was at a loss to understand
  the Government that applied coercion to the very people to whom it was
  preparing to hand over the government of Southern Ireland, and Mr. <font
  class="sc">Inskip</font> was equally at a loss to understand the policy
  of the noble lord, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="page513"
  id="page513"></a>[pg 513]</span> seemed to think that conciliation was
  incompatible with putting down crime.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, June 23rd.</i>&mdash;A large company, including the
  <font class="sc">Queen</font> and Princess <font class="sc">Mary</font>,
  attended the House of Lords to see Prince <font class="sc">Albert</font>
  take his seat as Duke of <font class="sc">York</font>. It was unfortunate
  that the new peer was unable to wait for the ensuing debate, for Lord
  <font class="sc">Newton</font> was in his best form. His theme was the
  absurdity of the present Parliamentary arrangement under which the Peers
  were kept kicking their heels in London for the best months of the year,
  then overwhelmed with business for a week or two, and finally despatched
  to the country in time for the hunting season, which nowadays most of
  them were too much impoverished to enjoy. Lord <font
  class="sc">Curzon</font> condescended a little from his usual Olympian
  heights, and declared that one of the drawbacks to conducting business in
  that House was the difficulty of inducing noble Lords to attend it after
  dinner.</p>

  </div>
  <p>To judge by Mr. <font class="sc">Asquith's</font> recent speeches
  outside he meant to have delivered a thundering philippic against our
  continued occupation of Mesopotamia. Some of the sting was taken out of
  the indictment by the publication of an official statement showing that
  Great Britain was remaining there at the request of the Allies. After
  all, as Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> observed in his reply,
  it would not be an economical policy to withdraw to Basra if we were to
  be immediately requested to return to Baghdad.</p>

  <p>The rest of the evening was devoted to a renewal of the protests
  against Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill's</font> "Red Army." Among the
  critics were Mr. <font class="sc">Esmond Harmsworth</font> and Mr. <font
  class="sc">Oswald Mosley</font>, the two "babies" of the House, and the
  <font class="sc">Minister</font> adopted quite a fatherly tone in
  recalling his own callow youth, when he too, just after the Boer War,
  denounced "the folly of gaudy and tinselled uniforms."</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, June 24th.</i>&mdash;On behalf of the Government Lord
  <font class="sc">Onslow</font> gave a rather chilly welcome to Lord <font
  class="sc">Balfour of Burleigh's</font> Bill for the regulation of
  advertisements. It is true that the noble author had explained that his
  object was to secure "publicity without offence," but I believe he had no
  desire to cramp the <font class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> style.</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Eric Geddes</font> belongs to that wicked species
  of <i>fauna</i> that defends itself when attacked. He complained this
  afternoon that Mr. <font class="sc">Asquith</font> had in his recent
  speeches "trounced a beginner," but Sir <font class="sc">Eric</font>
  showed, for a novice, considerable aggressive power. He claimed that the
  Ministry of Transport had already saved a cool million by securing the
  abrogation of an extravagant contract entered into by Mr. <font
  class="sc">Asquith's</font> Government. The <font class="sc">ex
  Premier</font>, however, insisted that if a mistake had been made the
  Railway Department of the Board of Trade could have corrected it just as
  well as its grandiose successor and at an infinitely smaller cost.</p>

<h3>THE NEW COURTIERSHIP.</h3>

  <blockquote>
  <p>(<i>With profound acknowledgment to the writer of the article on
  "Heroine Worship" in "The Times" of June 24th.</i>)</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>While thrones and dynasties have rocked or fallen in the great world
  upheaval of the last six years, there remains one form of monarchy which
  has proved impervious to all the shocks of circumstance&mdash;the
  monarchy of genius. If proof be demanded of this assertion we need only
  point to the wonderful manifestations of loyalty evoked in the last week
  by the advent of the Queen of the Film World and her admirable consort.
  The adoration of <font class="sc">Mary Pickford</font> has been compared
  with that of <font class="sc">Mary Queen of Scots</font>, and not without
  some show of reason, for the appeal which her acting, makes is always to
  the sense of chivalry which, in however sentimental a form, is
  characteristic of our race.</p>

  <p>But the noble adulation which the latest of our royal visitors
  inspires is deeper and more universal than that prompted by the charm and
  the misfortunes of her namesake. <font class="sc">Mary Queen of
  Scots</font>, as the evidence of contemporary portraits conclusively
  establishes, was not conspicuous for her personal beauty. In the "Queen
  business" she was a failure, and her prestige is largely if not entirely
  posthumous. Her character has been impugned by historians; even her most
  faithful champions have not pronounced her impeccable.</p>

  <p>Centuries were necessary to raise <font class="sc">Mary Queen of
  Scots</font> to her somewhat insecure pinnacle of devotion; by the
  alchemy of a machine centuries have been shortened to days and nights in
  the meteoric career of Miss <font class="sc">Pickford</font>. Yet merit
  has joined fortune in high cabal. Handicapped by a somewhat uneuphonious
  patronymic, <font class="sc">Mary Pickford</font> has established her
  rule without recourse to any of the disputable methods adopted by her
  predecessor. At home in all the "palaces" of both hemispheres, she owes
  her triumphs to the triple endowment of genius, loveliness and
  gentleness. Moreover, in the highest sense she is truly an ambassadress
  of our race, for the kiss which she so graciously bestowed on Mlle. <font
  class="sc">Suzanne Lenglen</font> at Wimbledon on Wednesday last has
  probably done even more to heal the wounds inflicted on our gallant
  Allies by the disastrous policy of Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd
  George</font> than the heroic efforts of <i>The Times</i> to maintain the
  Entente in its integrity.</p>

  <p>The parallels and contrasts with <font class="sc">Mary Queen of
  Scots</font> need not be further laboured. But far too little stress has
  been laid on the rare felicity of a union which links the name of Mary
  with that of Douglas. The annals of British chivalry contain no more
  romantic or splendid entries than those associated with Sir <font
  class="sc">James Douglas</font>, alternately styled the "Good" and the
  "Black," hero of seventy battles and the victor in fifty-seven, peerless
  as a raider, who crowned a glorious career by his mission to Palestine
  with the embalmed heart of <font class="sc">Bruce</font>, and his death
  in action against the Moors. His illustrious namesake is now conducting a
  "raid" on our shores of a purely educational and humanitarian nature, and
  our welcome, while it expresses the rare and momentous influence of the
  film, is no mere gratitude for pleasure afforded; it is rather the
  recognition of a human touch tending to make the whole English-speaking
  world kin.</p>

  <p>The visit is not unattended by risks, for the ardour of enthusiasm
  imposes a corresponding strain on the endurance of this august and
  inimitable pair. But there can be no doubt as to the absolute sincerity
  and spontaneity of these marvellous demonstrations of loyal affection. We
  can only hope that, to borrow the noble phrase of the Roman Senate in
  their address to <font class="sc">Nero</font> on the death of <font
  class="sc">Agrippina</font>, Queen <font class="sc">Pickford</font> the
  First may "endure her felicity with fortitude." Conspicuous grandeur has
  its penalties as well as its privileges, but the chivalric instinct is
  still alive in our midst; and all of us who are not perverted or debased
  by the malign "wizardry" of the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font>
  will spring to the defence of <font class="sc">Mary</font> "the
  Sweetheart of the World," and <font class="sc">Douglas</font> "tender and
  true," in their hours of peril. In that high emprise the gentlemen of the
  world, however humble, stand, as of old time, side by side and shoulder
  to shoulder.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF THE MOTHERS.</h3>

  <p>We were sitting in the smoking-room when the Venerable Archdeacon
  entered. He had been so long absent that we asked him the reason.</p>

  <p>Had he been ill?</p>

  <p>Ill? Not he. He never was better in his life. He had merely been on a
  motor tour with his mother.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," someone inquired&mdash;an equally elderly
  member&mdash;almost with anger, certainly with a kind of outraged
  surprise, "that you have a mother still living?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have," said the Man of God. "My mother is not only living
  but is in the pink of condition."</p>

  <p>"And how old is she?" the questioner continued.</p>

  <p>"She is ninety-one," said the Archdeacon proudly.</p>

  <p>Most of us looked at him with wonder and respect&mdash;even a touch of
  awe.</p>

  <p>"And still motoring!" I commented.</p>

  <p>"She delights in motoring."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the angry man, "you needn't be so conceited about it. You
  are not the only person with an aged mother. I have a mother too."</p>

  <p>We switched round to this new centre of surprise. It was more
  incredible that this man should have a mother even than the Archdeacon.
  No one had ever suspected him of anything so extreme, for he had a long
  white beard and hobbled with a stick.</p>

  <p>"And how old may your mother be?" the Archdeacon inquired.</p>

  <p>"My mother is ninety-two."</p>

  <p>"And is she well and hearty?"</p>

  <p>"My mother," he replied, "is in rude health&mdash;or, as you would
  say, full of beans." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page515"
  id="page515"></a>[pg 515]</span></p>

  <p>The Archdeacon made a deprecatory movement, repudiating the
  metaphor.</p>

  <p>"She not only motors," the layman pursued, "but she can walk. Can your
  mother walk?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say," said the Archdeacon, "that my mother has to be
  helped a good deal."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said the layman.</p>

  <p>"But," the Archdeacon continued, "she has all her other faculties. Can
  your mother still read?"</p>

  <p>"My mother is a most accomplished and assiduous knitter," said the
  bearded man.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, no doubt," the Archdeacon agreed; "but my question was, Can
  she still read?"</p>

  <p>"With glasses&mdash;yes," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed the Archdeacon, "I thought so. Now my dear mother can
  still read the smallest print without glasses."</p>

  <p>We murmured our approval.</p>

  <p>"And more," the Archdeacon went on, "she can thread her own
  needle."</p>

  <p>We approved again.</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," said the other, "but sight is not everything.
  Can your mother hear?"</p>

  <p>"She can hear all that I say to her," replied the Archdeacon.</p>

  <p>"Ah! but you probably raise your voice, and she is accustomed to it.
  Could she hear a stranger? Could she hear me?"</p>

  <p>Remembering the tone of some of his after-lunch conversations I
  suggested that perhaps it would be well if on occasions she could not. He
  glowered down such frivolousness and proceeded with his
  cross-examination. "Are you trying to assure us that your mother is not
  in the least bit deaf?"</p>

  <p>"Well," the Archdeacon conceded, "I could not go so far as to say that
  her hearing is still perfect."</p>

  <p>The layman smiled his satisfaction. "In other words," he said, "she
  uses a trumpet?"</p>

  <p>The Archdeacon was silent.</p>

  <p>"She uses a trumpet, Sir? Admit it."</p>

  <p>"Now and then," said the Archdeacon, "my dear mother has recourse to
  that aid."</p>

  <p>"I knew it!" exclaimed the other. "My mother can hear every word. She
  goes to the theatre too. Now your mother would have to go to the cinema
  if she wished to be entertained."</p>

  <p>"My mother," said the Archdeacon, "would not be interested in the
  cinema" (he pronounced it ki-n&#275;ma); "her mind is of a more serious
  turn."</p>

  <p>"My mother is young enough to be interested in anything," said the
  other. "And there is not one of her thirty-eight grandchildren of whose
  progress she is not kept closely informed."</p>

  <p>He leaned back with a gesture of triumph.</p>

  <p>"How many grandchildren did you say?" the Archdeacon inquired. "I
  didn't quite catch."</p>

  <p>"Thirty-eight," the other man replied.</p>

  <p>Across the cleric's ascetic features a happy smile slowly and
  conqueringly spread. "My mother," he said, "has fifty-two grandchildren.
  And now," he turned to me, "which of us would you say has won this
  entertaining contest?"</p>

  <p>"I should not like to decide," I said. "I am&mdash;fortunately perhaps
  for your mothers&mdash;no Solomon. My verdict is that both of you are
  wonderfully lucky men."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>We have had to wait four years for the concluding volumes of <i>The
  Life of Benjamin Disraeli</i> (<font class="sc">Murray</font>), but, as
  the engaged couple said of the tunnel, "it was worth it," for in the
  interval Mr. <font class="sc">Buckle</font> has been able to enrich his
  work with a wealth of new material. This includes <font
  class="sc">Disraeli's</font> correspondence with <font class="sc">Queen
  Victoria</font> during his two Premierships, and the still more
  remarkable letters that he wrote to the two favoured sisters, <font
  class="sc">Anne</font>, Lady <font class="sc">Chesterfield</font>, and
  <font class="sc">Selina</font>, Lady <font class="sc">Bradford</font>,
  during the last eight years of his life. To one or other of them he wrote
  almost every day, and from the sixteen hundred letters that have been
  preserved Mr. <font class="sc">Buckle</font> has selected with happy
  discretion a multitude of passages which throw a vivid light upon the
  political events of the time and upon <font class="sc">Disraeli's</font>
  own character. Whereas the first four volumes of the biography might be
  likened to a good sound Burgundy, thanks to these letters the last two
  sparkle and stimulate like a vintage champagne. As we read them we seem
  to be present at the scenes described, to overhear the discussions at the
  Cabinet, to catch a glimpse of the actors <i>en déshabillé</i>. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Buckle</font> says that "Disraeli, from first to last,
  regarded his life as a brightly tinted romance, with himself as hero." In
  one of his letters to Lady <font class="sc">Bradford</font> he says, "I
  live for Power and the Affections." A poseur, no doubt, he was, but not a
  charlatan. His industry was amazing and his insight almost uncanny. "I
  know not why Japan should not become the Sardinia of the Mongolian East,"
  he writes in 1875. To the political student these Volumes will be almost
  as fruitful a field as <font class="sc">Burke</font>; for myself, I have
  found them more fascinating than any novel.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It seams a great pity that Mr. <font class="sc">Kipling's</font>
  <i>Letters of Travel</i> (<font class="sc">Macmillan</font>) contains
  nothing later than 1913. It would have been particularly interesting to
  see how far the events of the great tragedy might have modified or
  aggravated his scorn against those who do not see eye to eye with him. In
  the pre-war <font class="sc">Kipling</font>, as we have him here,
  "Labour" is always the enemy, "Democracy" the hypocritical cant of cranks
  and slackers. What do they know of England who only <font
  class="sc">Kipling</font> know? Well, they know one side of it, and a
  fine side. The first sheaf of letters&mdash;"From Tideway to Tideway
  (1892)"&mdash;describes a tour through America and Canada, with a rather
  too obvious bias against the habits and institutions of the former, but
  with so eloquent a presentation of the dream and fact of imperial
  pioneering service that it might draw even from a Little Englander,
  "Almost thou persuadest me!" "Letters to the Family" deals with the
  Canada of 1907, a very different entity from the Canada of to-day after
  the later Imperial Conferences and five years' trial of war, but none the
  less interesting to hear about. A voyage in 1913, undertaken "for no
  other reason but to discover the sun," is the begetter of the third
  group, "Egypt and the Egyptians," the first letter of which will not, I
  imagine, be reprinted and framed by the P. and O. Brilliant word-pictures
  of things seen, thumbnail sketches of odd characters, clever records of
  remembered speech, intelligent comment from a well-defined point of
  view&mdash;these you will have expected, and will get.</p>

  <p>Lady <font class="sc">Dorothy Mills</font>, who has already made some
  success as a holder of the mirror up to a certain section of ultra-smart
  society, continues this benevolent work in her new novel, <i>The Laughter
  of Fools</i> (<font class="sc">Duckworth</font>). It is a clever tale,
  almost horridly well told, about the war-time behaviour of the rottenest
  idle-rich element, in the disorganised and hectic London of 1917-18.
  Perhaps the observation is superficial; but, just so far as it pretends
  to go, Lady <font class="sc">Dorothy's</font> method does undoubtedly get
  home. Her heroine, <i>Louise</i>, is a detestable little egoist, whose
  vanity and entire lack of <i>moral</i> render her an easy victim to the
  vampire crowd into which she drifts. The "sensation" scenes, night club
  orgies, dope parties and the like will probably bring the book a boom of
  curiosity; but there are not wanting signs, in the author's easy unforced
  method, that with a larger theme she may one day write a considerably
  bigger book. <i>The Laughter of Fools</i>, one may say, ends tragically;
  <i>Louise</i>, after exhausting all her other activities, being left
  about to join a nursing expedition to Northern Russia. Which, judging by
  previous revelations of her general incompetence, is where the tragedy
  comes in&mdash;for the prospective patients. A moral rather carefully
  unmoralised is how I should sum up an unpleasant but shrewdly written
  tale.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>To <i>The Diary of a U-Boat Commander</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hutchinson</font>) "<font class="sc">Etienne</font>" adds an
  introduction and some explanatory notes. In one of these notes we are
  told that the Diary was left in a locker when the Commander handed over
  his boat to the British. We are all at liberty to form any opinion we
  like on the use made of this Diary and I am not going to reveal mine.
  For, after all, it is the book itself&mdash;however produced&mdash;that
  matters, and even those of us who are getting a little shy of literature
  connected with the War will find something original and intriguing in
  this Diary. With what seems to me unnecessary frankness the publisher
  refers to the Commander's "incredible exploits and adventures on the high
  seas." For my own part my powers of belief in regard to the War are
  almost unlimited, and the only thing that really staggers me here is the
  mentality of the diarist. From the record of his purely private life,
  which is also exposed in these pages, I gather that he was as unfortunate
  in love as in war; but he seems to have loved with a whole-hearted
  passion that goes far to redeem him. I must add a word of praise for Mr.
  <font class="sc">Frank Mason's</font> illustrations, which contributed
  generously to my entertainment.</p>

<h2>AN OPEN LETTER TO FRANCE.</h2>

  <p>Mr. Punch had kissed the lady's hand and she had smiled upon him very
  graciously, for they were old friends.</p>

  <p>"I have brought you a letter from myself," he said.</p>

  <p>"Shall I read it while you wait?" said Madame la France.</p>

  <p>"Please, no. I never read my contributors' compositions in their
  presence. It is embarrassing to both sides. And I want you to take your
  time over this one, and consider carefully whether it is suitable for
  publication in your Press. I have enclosed a stamped and addressed
  envelope, to be utilized in the event of your deciding to return my
  communication with regrets. In any case I propose to publish it in my own
  paper, <i>The London Charivari</i>."</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Here begins the letter</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<font class="sc">Nearest and Dearest of Allies</font>.&mdash;You and
  I (I speak for my country, though I have not been asked to do so) have
  gone through so much together that it would be an infinite pity if any
  misunderstanding were suffered to cloud our friendship for want of a
  little candour on my part. No <i>Entente</i> can retain its cordiality
  without mutual candour; and hitherto the reticence has been all on our
  side.</p>

  <p>"Not when your splendid courage and your noble sacrifices gave us a
  theme; then we were always frankly loud in our admiration; but when we
  reflected upon what I may venture to call your faults and failings.
  Whatever we may have thought about them during all those terrible years,
  you will find in our public statements no note of criticism and not a
  single word that did not breathe a true loyalty. You too were generous in
  your praise of us when we won battles; and at the end, with your own
  <font class="sc">Foch</font> for witness, you were quick to recognise
  what part we played in those great Autumn days that brought the crowning
  victory. But it almost looks as if your memory of our brotherhood in arms
  were beginning to fail; as if we, who were then hailed as your 'glorious
  Ally,' were about to resume our old name&mdash;it has already been
  revived in some quarters&mdash;of 'Perfide Albion.'</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know that the best of France is loyal to us; that her true
  chivalry understands. But what of your public that is all ear for the
  so-called <i>Echo de Paris</i>, with its constant incitement to jealousy
  and suspicion of England? What of your second-rate Press and its
  pin-pricking policy, connived at, if not actually encouraged, by your
  Government?</p>

  <p>"Of course I recognise that you never really liked the idea of all
  those British soldiers making themselves at home in your country, though
  they did it as nicely as it could be done, and made hosts of friends in
  the process. I can believe that we should not have been too well pleased
  at having a like number of French troops established between Dover and
  London. I don't say we should have charged you rent for every yard of
  their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>[pg
  518]</span> trenches or claimed heavy damages for any injury they might
  have done to our roads in the course of defending the Metropolis from our
  common enemy. But we certainly should not have been depressed when we
  found that they needn't stay any longer. Still I hope we should have
  registered on the tablets of our hearts a permanent record indicating
  that we appreciated their friendliness in coming to our support.</p>

  <p>"But I am told that the secret of the present attitude of our French
  critics is that they cannot forgive us for having used the soil of France
  in order to defend our own. Is this quite fair or even decent? Let me
  refresh their memory of the motive that brought us into this War. The
  true motive was not to be found in the duty imposed upon us by Germany's
  breach of the Belgian Treaty, though that in itself furnished us with an
  unanswerable reason. The true motive was our desire to help you. We had
  nothing in those days to fear for ourselves. We knew that our Fleet was
  strong enough to protect our own shores. We had not yet appreciated the
  submarine menace; we did not recognise what your loss of the Channel
  ports might mean for us. We entered the War because we could not look on
  and see you overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>"You complain, again, that, in contrast to yourselves, we have got all
  we wanted out of the War. As a fact we wanted nothing; but let that pass.
  You point to the destruction of the German Fleet as if it were a private
  gain for us and us alone, and not the removal of a danger to the whole
  world. And what of the German armies&mdash;now in process of reduction to
  a mere police force? Did you derive no advantage from the overthrow of a
  system which was always a greater menace to you than the German Fleet
  ever was to us? And, though we did not pretend to be a military nation,
  had we not some little share in that achievement?</p>

  <p>"And what of your <i>revanche</i>? How do the German Colonies, which
  we have freed and now hold in trust&mdash;how do these compare with your
  solid recovery of Alsace-Lorraine? No, you have not come badly out of
  Armageddon.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have suffered, that we know; you have suffered even more than
  we, who at least were spared the ravaging of our lands. And never for a
  moment do we forget this. But you too must not forget that where the soil
  of France suffered most there thickest lie our English dead, who fought
  for England's freedom, yes, but for your freedom too. And it is we who
  stand by you still, pledged to be once more at your side if the same
  peril ever come again; though America, for whom nothing was once too
  good, should fail you in your need.</p>

  <p>"There, I have said what I wanted to say; what your best friends here
  have been thinking this many a day. For your best friends are not, as you
  might imagine, to be found in a certain section of our Press who for
  their own political or private ends are prepared to encourage all your
  suspicions if so they may injure the good name of our statesmen who meet
  you in council for the common cause. Your best friends are the men who
  deplore those suspicions; who beg you, as I do here, to get them swept
  away as being unworthy of a great nation and a great alliance.</p>

<p class="center">"For this end, Believe me, dear Madame, to be at your service as always,</p>

<h2>"PUNCH."</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Here ends the letter.</i>]</p>

  <p>"And now, dear lady," said Mr. Punch, "let me say that, if there is
  anything in this letter which seems&mdash;but only on the
  surface&mdash;to be inconsistent with my profound devotion to your
  person, it is the first word of the kind that I have put on paper since
  our friendship began. All through the War and the hardly less trying
  times of Peace that have followed it I have not once swerved from my
  loyalty to you. Accept, I beg of you, the renewed assurance of my
  affection the most sincere, and, for token, this latest of a series in
  which you will find many proofs of the love I bear you&mdash;my</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
